[`tidyhydat`](https://docs.ropensci.org/tidyhydat) is another R package for accessing
data from ECCC. In this case, `tidyhydat` gives access to the [National Water Data Archive
(HYDAT)](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/water-overview/quantity/monitoring/survey/data-products-services/national-archive-hydat.html).

HYDAT contains lots of data including stream flow (historical and real-time), water levels,
station metrics and information on data types and codes.

Here we'll go through a brief example of how hydrology data from `tidyhydat`
can compliment weather data from `weathercan` (and vice versa).

## Setup

### Loading packages

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(weathercan)
library(tidyhydat)

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(glue)
```

### Prep HYDAT data

`tidyhydat` data needs to be downloaded and cached locally in order to be used
(Note, this can take a while!)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
download_hydat()
```


## Exploring climate and hydrology

In the summer of 2020, my region (Brandon, Manitoba) experienced an incredibly
heavy rain fall event. Our downspout was ripped off the gutter and many people in the
area experienced flooding as rain poured into their basements.

Let's take a look at how this event was captured by weather and hydrometric stations
monitored by ECCC.

The event occurred in late June/early July, so let's give ourselves a two-month
range.

```{r}
dates <- c("2020-06-01", "2020-08-01")
```

We'll find a local Brandon weather station that has daily data for this range
```{r}
stations_search("brandon", interval = "day",
                starts_latest = 2020, ends_earliest = 2020)
```

In this case "A" is for "Airport", let's go with that!

```{r}
rain <- weather_dl(station_ids = 50821, interval = "day", start = dates[1], end = dates[2])
```

Take a quick look:

```{r}
ggplot(data = rain, aes(x = date, y = total_rain)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Total Rain (mm)", expand = c(0,0))
```

Yikes! You can see why my downspout came off!

Now let's get some HYDAT data to compare. First we'll find a local station

```{r}
search_stn_name("brandon")
```

There are a couple of options, but whoops, one's from Quebec! Let's filter this
to only Manitoba and only stations with 2020 data with the `hy_stn_data_range()`
function.

```{r}
search_stn_name("brandon") %>%
  filter(PROV_TERR_STATE_LOC == "MB") %>%
  pull(STATION_NUMBER) %>%
  hy_stn_data_range() %>%
  filter(Year_from <= 2020, Year_to >= 2020)
```

Hmm, let's see what kind of data is available by looking at the included
`hy_data_types` data frame.

```{r}
filter(hy_data_types, DATA_TYPE %in% c("H", "Q"))
```

Great! We have both flow and water level data for a station number "05MH001",
"Assiniboine River at Brandon".


Let's grab the flow and water level data for this station.
```{r}
flow <- hy_daily_flows(station_number = "05MH001",
                       start_date = dates[1], end_date = dates[2])
level <- hy_daily_levels(station_number = "05MH001",
                         start_date = dates[1], end_date = dates[2])
```

### Ploting rain and flow

```{r}
g <- ggplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  geom_bar(data = rain, aes(x = date, y = (total_rain * 2)), stat = "identity",
           alpha = 0.7, fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  geom_line(data = flow, aes(x = Date, y = Value)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = bquote(Total~Flow~(m^3/s)), expand = c(0, 0),
                     limits = c(0, max(flow$Value * 1.1)),
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(transform = ~ . / 2, name = "Total Rain (mm)"))
g
```


Interesting, looks like there's a bit of a lag between the rain event and the
dramatic increase in water flow in the Assiniboine (unsurprisingly, this is
called "lag to peak").

Let's add a bit of information about this lag to peak.

```{r}
d <- data.frame(dates = c(rain$date[which.max(rain$total_precip)],
                          flow$Date[which.max(flow$Value)]),
                y = max(flow$Value) + 5)

g +
  geom_path(data = d, aes(x = dates, y = y),
              arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "lines"), ends = "both", type = "closed")) +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           x = d$dates[1] + (d$dates[2] - d$dates[1])/2,
           y = d$y[1] + 10,
           label = glue("{d$dates[2] - d$dates[1]}-day delay"))
```

We can expect a lag like this because much of the flow being captured by the Brandon HYDAT
station is from precipitation in the upstream catchment area (not only from
local contributions), which takes time to travel.


### Ploting rain and water level

```{r}
g <- ggplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  geom_bar(data = rain,
           aes(x = date, y = (total_rain/65) + min(level$Value)),
           stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7, fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  geom_line(data = level, aes(x = Date, y = Value)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Water Level (m)", expand = c(0, 0),
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(transform = ~ (. - min(level$Value)) * 65,
                                         name = "Total Rain (mm)")) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(min(level$Value), max(level$Value)*1.001))
g

```

Again there looks to be a lag, let's see if it's the same as before.

```{r}
d <- data.frame(dates = c(rain$date[which.max(rain$total_precip)],
                          level$Date[which.max(level$Value)]),
                y = max(level$Value)*1.00025)

g +
  geom_path(data = d, aes(x = dates, y = y),
              arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "lines"), ends = "both", type = "closed")) +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           x = d$dates[1] + (d$dates[2] - d$dates[1])/2,
           y = d$y[1] * 1.0002,
           label = glue("{d$dates[2] - d$dates[1]}-day delay"))
```


### Ploting flow and water level

Looks like the flow and water level match up, perhaps we should take a closer look.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position.inside = c(0.8, 0.8)) +
  geom_line(data = flow, aes(x = Date, y = Value, colour = "Flow"),
            linewidth = 2) +
  geom_line(data = level, linewidth = 1,
            aes(x = Date, y = (Value - min(Value) + 0.1) * 130, colour = "Level")) +
  scale_y_continuous(bquote(Total~Flow~(m^3/s)), expand = c(0, 0),
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(transforsm = ~ ./130 + min(level$Value) - 0.1,
                                         name = "Water Level (m)")) +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Type",
                      values = c("Flow" = "cornflowerblue",
                                 "Level" = "grey30"))
```

Almost a perfect match between water level and flow (which makes sense).
